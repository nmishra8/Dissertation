\section{Notations}
\label{sec:notation}

The set of real numbers is denoted by $\R$. $\R^d$ denotes the set of
$d$-dimensional vectors of real numbers; $\R^{d\times n}$ denotes the
set of real $d\times n$ dimensional matrices. We denote the vectors by
lower-case and matrices with upper-case boldfaced letters. The
transpose of a vector $\x$ (or matrix $\mathbf{X}$) is denoted by
$\x^T$ or just $\x'$. $\|\x\|_2$ is the $\mathcal{L}_2$ norm of vector
$\x$, i.e. $\x = \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{d} x^2[i]}$.  $\|\mathbf{x}\|_1$
is the $\mathcal{L}_1$ norm of the vector $\mathbf{x}$; \ie $\|\mathbf{x}\|_1 =
\sum_{i = 1}^{d}  | x[i] |$. $\|\mathbf{x}\|_0$
is the $\mathcal{L}_0$ norm of the vector $\mathbf{x}$; \ie $\|\mathbf{x}\|_0 =
\sum_{i = 1}^{d}   I(\beta[i]) $, where $I(.)$ is an indicator function such as $I(\beta[i]) = 1$ if $\beta[i] \neq 0$, it is 0 otherwise . The notation $\x \sim \mathcal{D}$ represents that $\x$ is drawn from the distribution $\mathcal{D}$. 
$\E[\x]$ denotes the expected value of $\x$. $x_+$ is used as a shorthand for $\max(x,0)$.
