I am grateful to so many people for all their support through my Ph.D. life. First,
I would like to say thanks to my parents who have always been there for me. I could
only see them once a year but thanks to technology I got to talk to them almost every day
and they could not be more encouraging. My brother has supported me throughout
my efforts as well, he is probably the main reason that I thought that graduate
school would be a great place for me. He always discussed my research with me and
kept me focused.

I have to thank my advisors Hank and John for helping me so much in every aspect.
Everything I know about computer systems comes from my interactions with Hank.
He's one of the most patient, hard-working and kind person I have known. He is
relentless in his efforts. One of my papers with him got us really bad reviews and I felt like I should just give up on systems research because its really hard to satisfy all the comments that reviewers told us. But, he reassured me that the work was good and 
the paper was finally selected.
