\section{Conclusion}
This paper explores machine learning methods for predicting
application interference in computing systems.  Specifically, we
explore several state-of-the-art regularization techniques for
high-dimensional problems---when many more features are available than
samples---and we conclude that existing linear techniques are not
accurate enough, while existing higher-order techniques are accurate
but slow.  Inspired by these observations we present \SYSTEMESP{}, a
combination of linear feature selection with higher-order model
building that achieves the practicality of linear models with the
accuracy of higher-order models.  We have demonstrated that
\SYSTEMESP{}'s quantitative predictions produce significantly better
schedules than existing heuristics for both single and multi-node
systems, with up to 1.8$\times$ improvement in application completion
time and significantly lower variance.  Additionally, \SYSTEMESP{}
achieves much higher prediction accuracies than prior
approaches---over 93\% when considering three or more applications.
We have made the source code available so that others may improve on
or compare with \SYSTEMESP{}.
