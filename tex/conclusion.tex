\section{Conclusion}
While much recent work has built systems to support learning and big
data, in this work we use learning and big data to build better
systems.  Specifically by proposing \SYSTEM{}, a combination of
machine learning and control for managing resources to meet
performance requirements with minimal energy.  \SYSTEM{}'s unique
contribution is showing how machine learning and control theory can be
combined at runtime to provide more reliable performance and lower
energy than either in isolation.  Furthermore, this combination is not
just practical, it provides formal guarantees that the system will
converge to the desired performance.
